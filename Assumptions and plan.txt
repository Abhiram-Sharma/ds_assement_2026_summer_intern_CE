------Step 1------

since it is not nested, not hierarchical, and uniform datatypes, chosen to keep json to excel
all data to csv files to load and view in GUI(Excel) and DF(python)
converted artificial_ign_off_data to csv from json
output can be later converted to json if required to integrate with APIs

------Step 2------
available columns in all datasets
TLM (Telematics - high rate)
- ID - 
- VEHICLE_ID - String
- TIMESTAMP - datetime - dd-mm-yy hh:mm:ss
- SPEED - 
- IGNITION_STATUS - 
- EV_BATTERY_LEVEL - float
- ODOMETER - 

TRG (Triggers - low rate)
- CTS - datetime - dd-mm-yy hh:mm:ss
- PNID - String
- NAME - String
- VAL - String(as per raw data, will be divided to process better)

MAP (Mapping Primary vehicle ID from TLM to PNID in TRG)
- ID - String
- IDS - Array of Strings
1 : many mapping

SYN (Synthetic override - all moments of ignition off)
- Vehicle ID
- Timestamp (410 events)
- type (all are artificial_event)

------Step 3------
Cleaning Data
1. Addressing nulls
2. removing duplicates

------Step 3------
Joining data
transform MAP from A to B

A. ID => list of IDS
B. each IDS => its corresponding ID

1. Joined MAP and TRG using PNID and IDS

------Step 3------
Split the merged Df into Charge_State, EV_Charge_State, Ignition_Cycle
find outliers

----------------------------------------------

Deduced That:

1. Given data is for 19 vehicles
2. Given Telematics data is from 01-09-2021 00:00:03 untill 30-01-2022 23:59:36
3. 10,48,575 datapoints between 151 days
4. Triggers classified into 3 categories (Charge_State, EV_Charge_State, Ignition_Cycle)
5. Charge_State gives value as battery level
6. EV_Charge_State gives value as Active / Aborted / Complete
7. IGN_CYCL has value only as ON / OFF
8. 410 event synthetic events occuring between 18-12-2021 18:53:37 untill 31-01-2022 19:13:06
9. 39,262 PNIDs have trigger data, but are not mapped to any of the vehicle IDs
10. only 9935 proper triggers left after cleaning
11. after cleaning and merging, TRG data is from 2021-09-01 05:56:15 until 2022-01-31 05:21:30

Charging Event Detection
12. Possibility of Regeneraative Breaking (when the engine is on)
13. 2% delta over 300 seconds timestamps can be used to check for REAL charging when the ignition is OFF
14. 4% delta over 300 seconds timestamps can be used to check for REAL charging when the ignition is ON.

----------------------------------------------

Issues:
1. TLM has 93 timestamps with microseconds, problem in conversion
2. 6 vehicles are not mapped to any PNID (i.e no Trigger Data Available, only Telementary)

3. Timezone mismatch between TRG and TLM through IST and UTC
